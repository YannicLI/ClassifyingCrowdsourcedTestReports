# Classifying Crowdsourced Mobile Test Reports with Image Features

Abstract Crowdsourced testing has become a popular mobile application testing method, and it is capable of simulating real usage scenarios and detect- ing various bugs with a large workforce. However, inspecting and classifying the overwhelming number of crowdsourced test reports has become a time- consuming yet inevitable task. To alleviate such tasks, in the past decades, software engineering researchers have proposed many automatic test report classification techniques. However, these techniques may become less effective for crowdsourced mobile application testing, where test reports often consist of insufficient text descriptions and rich screenshots and are fundamentally different from those of traditional desktop software. To bridge the gap, we firstly fuse features extracted from text descriptions and screenshots to classify crowdsourced test reports via machine learning and deep learning.
